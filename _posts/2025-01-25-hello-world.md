# Hello World!

Welcome to my minimalist tech blog. This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on programming, technology, and various technical adventures.

Here's some Python code with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Let's build something cool!"

# Call the function
result = hello_world()
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

And here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    return `Welcome to TechnoYoda's blog!`;
};

greet("World");
```

Some bash commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Setting up the environment..."
npm install
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp
```
